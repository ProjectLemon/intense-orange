#Intense Orange
Intense Orange is a party game for android that is built upon the wifi direct
technology in order to create a party game that is a mixture of a videogame   
and a boardgame. 

One phone is selected to be the game leader and board while the players split up
into teams where one phone in each team connects to the game leader phone and
will be used as that teams controller.

##Open source
At it's core, intense orange really is a platform that will allow parts to be
added. When the final product is released everyone will be able to use our
framwork to integrate their own minigames and contribute to the intense.

##Contribute
Since the base is not completed yet. You will not be able to build any games for
it. However, there is always the possibility to help out with the development of
the foundation so that it will hit release faster!
